  <b>Coding -- 2 Yrs</b><br />
  While working on my Associate's degree I have become familiar with multiple front and back-end
   programming languages:
  <ul style="list-style: none;">
    <li>Java</li>
    <li>C++</li>
    <li>C#</li>
    <li>HTML/CSS3</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
    <li>jQuery</li>
    <li>ASP.NET</li>
  </ul>
  Using these languages I have created a CLI video game, a basic version of Facebook and Twitter,
  as well as multiple websites, among other projects.
  <br /><br /><br />

  <b>Prior Experience</b><br />
  In addition to my Software Development education, I have worked in IT support, manufacturing, customer service, and as an archival aide. I pride myself on my problem-solving, communcation, and teamwork skills and have a passion for education.
